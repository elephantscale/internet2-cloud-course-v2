## Exercises: Design a Cost Effective Solutions for the Following Scenarios

---

## Exercise-1: A Scalable Web Farm

* We have a stock market application
* Currently the solution is implemented in house
* The peak capacity needed is 40 web servers; This is usually day time.  At night time, the demand drops and we can serve the demand with 5 web servers
* We are running about 50 web servers all the time

**Architect a cost effective solution**

## Exercise-2: Big Data Analytics

* Building from the scenario above...
* The appliction collects a lot of data. Few 100s of gigs each day, and a few Terabytes over the course of months
* Only fraction of the data (last 1 month of data) is neeed for real time analysis
* The rest can be analyzed in batch mode
* Currently all data is stored in a high-end database; that charges by terabyte stored
