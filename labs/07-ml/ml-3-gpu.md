# The Power of GPU

## Overview

GPU is the 'workhorse' of compute intensive workloads.  Here we will work through a few notebooks to see the impact of GPU

I have put together a repository of [Cool ML Demos](https://github.com/elephantscale/cool-ML-demos).  The image section has good notebooks to test CPU

## Lab-01: CIFAR-10 - Image Classifier

* [Notebook: Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify Images](https://github.com/elephantscale/cool-ML-demos/blob/main/image/cnn-cifar.ipynb)
* Open the above link in Google colab
* First disable GPU accelleration and run it.  Note the time taken.
* Now enable GPU and run it.  Compare the times before and after

## Lab-02: Cats and Dogs Classifier

* A classic, and always a crowd pleaser with cute cat and dog pics!
* [Notebook: Cat, Dog Classifier](https://github.com/elephantscale/cool-ML-demos/blob/main/image/img3-cat-dog-binary-classifier.ipynb)
* Open the above link in Google colab
* First disable GPU accelleration and run it.  Note the time taken.
* Now enable GPU and run it.  Compare the times before and after
