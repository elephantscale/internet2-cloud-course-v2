[Google Cloud VM types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource)

[Azure VM types](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/)

**Discuss VM types for following use cases**

**What are specific VM types (i.e. m2.xlarge) you might choose for each use case**

**Do a cost comparison (per month) across various clouds**

### A. Web Server

* Handles a lot of requests per seconds

### B. Database Server

* Needs very fast disk IO
* And lots of memory

### C. Chat Server

* Handles a lot of encrypted connections

### D. Caching server

* Needs a lot of memory

### E. GPU Machine for Deep Learning

* Need cutting edge GPU
